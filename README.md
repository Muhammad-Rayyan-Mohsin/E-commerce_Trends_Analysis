# Global E-Commerce Trends Analysis and Impact on Traditional Retail

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing global e-commerce trends and their influence on traditional retail. The aim is to understand how the rise of e-commerce has affected retail sales and consumer behavior worldwide. Various data analysis techniques, including PCA, customer lifetime value (CLV) calculation, and what-if analysis, are employed to explore these trends and their impact.

## Objectives

- Analyze global e-commerce data to identify key trends.
- Understand how e-commerce has influenced traditional retail sales.
- Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) for retail customers.
- Apply Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
- Perform what-if analysis to predict future outcomes under different scenarios.
- Visualize payment trends over the year using advanced visualization techniques.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project includes global e-commerce and retail sales data across various countries and industries. The data features include:

- Country
- Year
- E-commerce sales
- Retail sales
- Number of customers
- Payment methods
- Other relevant business metrics

## Steps Involved

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Loaded and cleaned the dataset.
- Handled missing values and removed outliers.
- Converted categorical data into numerical form where needed.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Examined global e-commerce trends over time.
- Analyzed payment trends and customer behavior using visualizations.
- Compared e-commerce growth with traditional retail sales.
  
### 3. PCA for Dimensionality Reduction
- Applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset, capturing the most significant features contributing to e-commerce growth.

### 4. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Calculation
- Calculated CLV to estimate the total worth of a customer to the business over time.
- Used customer transaction history and retention rate to derive CLV.

### 5. What-If Analysis
- Conducted what-if analysis to predict potential changes in sales under various e-commerce and retail scenarios.

### 6. Data Visualization
- Visualized trends using bar plots, line charts, and heatmaps.
- Examined the impact of different payment methods on sales across regions.

## Key Findings

- E-commerce sales have consistently grown in the last decade, outpacing traditional retail in many regions.
- Key factors driving e-commerce growth include the adoption of digital payment methods, the rise of mobile commerce, and shifting consumer preferences toward convenience.
- PCA revealed that certain features, such as payment method and delivery options, play a significant role in e-commerce success.
- The CLV analysis showed that repeat customers are highly valuable to businesses, especially in the e-commerce sector.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the substantial impact of e-commerce on traditional retail, offering valuable insights for businesses looking to adapt to the changing landscape. The analysis of customer lifetime value and key sales drivers provides actionable recommendations to enhance customer retention and drive business growth.
